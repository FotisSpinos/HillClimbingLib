# Sisyphos Hill Climbing

## Overview
Sisyphos is a hill climbing library written in typescript. The library implements a few hill climbing algorithms that can be used to solve several optimization problems.

<ins>**Implemented algorithms:**</ins>
1. Hill climbing
2. First choice hill climbing
3. Random restarts
4. Simulated annealing 

## Getting Started
<ins>**1. Downloading the repository:**</ins>

The repository does not have any dependencies and can be cloned using: `git clone https://github.com/FotisSpinos/Sisyphos-Hill-Climbing.git`

<ins>**2. Compiling into JavaScript:**</ins>

To compile the library make sure that you have installed the typescript compiler with version 4.4.3. Newer versions are likely to work but this is not tested. Finally, navigate to the directory containing the cloned repo and run: `tsc --project .\tsconfig.json`. A new folder called "outDir" should be created under the repo's root folder. The "outDir" should contain the compiled JavaScript file.
